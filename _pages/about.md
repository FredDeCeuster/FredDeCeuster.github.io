I obtained a <strong>PhD</strong> in computational astrophysics from [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), working with [Revd. Prof. Dr. Jeremy Yates](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/people/dr-jeremy-yates), [Prof. Dr. Peter Boyle](https://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/~paboyle/), and [Prof. Dr. James Hetherington](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/6295-james-hetherington). Here, I started developing [Magritte](/projects/magritte/): a software library for 3D line radiative transfer and synthetic obsevations.
Prior to that, I obtained a <strong>BSc</strong> and <strong>MSc</strong> in Physics from [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/).
