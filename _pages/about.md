I am a Research Scientist at the
<a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/lgi">Leuven Gravity Institute, KU Leuven</a>.
My research focuses on developing efficient and quantifiably accurate computational methods to
simulate complex astrophysical processes, such as relativistic hydrodynamics, radiation transport,
and chemistry, to allow us to compare our most sophisticated models with our best observations.

I obtained a <strong>PhD</strong> in computational astrophysics from [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), working with [Revd. Prof. Dr. Jeremy Yates](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/people/dr-jeremy-yates), [Prof. Dr. Peter Boyle](https://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/~paboyle/), and [Prof. Dr. James Hetherington](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/6295-james-hetherington). Here, I started developing [Magritte](/projects/magritte/): a software library for 3D line radiative transfer and synthetic obsevations.
Prior to that, I obtained a <strong>BSc</strong> and <strong>MSc</strong> in Physics from [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/).
