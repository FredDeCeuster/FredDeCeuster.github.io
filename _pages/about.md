My research focuses on developing <strong>efficient</strong> and <strong>quantifiably accurate</strong> computational methods to
simulate complex astrophysical processes, such as relativistic hydrodynamics, radiation transport,
and chemistry, to allow us to compare our most sophisticated models with our best observations.

I'm currently a Research Scientist at the [Leuven Gravity Institute](https://www.kuleuven.be/lgi) at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/).

As a <strong>postdoc</strong>, I've led the computational research division in the group of [Prof. Dr. Leen Decin](https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/staff/senior-staff/leen-decin) at the [Institute of Astronomy](https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster) ([KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/)).
I've obtained a <strong>PhD</strong> in computational astrophysics from [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), working with [Revd. Prof. Dr. Jeremy Yates](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/people/dr-jeremy-yates), [Prof. Dr. Peter Boyle](https://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/~paboyle/), and [Prof. Dr. James Hetherington](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/6295-james-hetherington). Here, I started developing [Magritte](/projects/magritte/): a software library for 3D line radiative transfer and synthetic obsevations.
Prior to that, I've obtained a <strong>BSc</strong> and <strong>MSc</strong> in Physics from [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/).
